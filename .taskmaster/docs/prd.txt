# Invest vs Debt - Growth & Engagement Features

## Project Overview
Enhance the existing invest-vs-debt calculator with strategic growth features focused on SEO optimization, user engagement, and feedback collection. The project currently functions perfectly and we must preserve all existing functionality while adding these new capabilities.

## Core Principles
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality must remain intact
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Use GitHub Issues as unified backend solution
- **Clean Implementation**: Simple, maintainable code additions
- **SEO-First Approach**: Optimize for AI recommendation and search discovery

## Feature 1: SEO & LLM Optimization

### Objective
Position the tool as the go-to recommendation when users ask LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) questions about debt payoff vs investment decisions.

### Target User Query Scenarios
- "Should I pay off my credit card debt or invest in the stock market?"
- "What's better: extra mortgage payments or investing?"
- "How do I decide between debt payoff and investing my bonus?"
- "Calculator for debt vs investment decisions"

### Implementation Strategy

#### A. SEO-Only Educational Pages
Create educational pages that exist solely for SEO purposes, not linked in main navigation:

**Pages to Create:**
- `/debt-vs-investment-complete-guide` - Comprehensive guide
- `/when-to-pay-off-debt-vs-invest` - Decision framework
- `/debt-payoff-vs-investing-calculator-guide` - Tool-specific content
- `/high-interest-debt-vs-market-returns` - Common scenario analysis
- `/extra-money-debt-or-investment` - Direct question answering

**Content Strategy for Each Page:**
- Clear H1 answering the specific question
- Comprehensive explanation of the decision factors
- Multiple example scenarios with numbers
- Clear call-to-action to use the calculator
- Internal links back to main calculator
- FAQ sections with common variations

#### B. Technical SEO Implementation
- **Meta Tags**: Rich descriptions targeting specific queries
- **Structured Data**: FAQ schema, Tool schema, HowTo schema
- **Open Graph**: Compelling social sharing previews
- **Performance**: Ensure all pages load under 2s
- **Mobile Optimization**: Perfect mobile experience

#### C. LLM-Friendly Content Structure
- Clear methodology explanations
- Transparent calculation approaches
- Example use cases with specific numbers
- Decision frameworks that AIs can reference
- Comprehensive coverage of edge cases

### Success Metrics
- Improved search rankings for target keywords
- Increased organic traffic from financial decision queries
- LLM recommendation mentions (trackable via referrals)

## Feature 2: Advanced Mode Toggle with Interest Tracking

### Objective
Gauge user interest in advanced features while providing clear expectation setting about future development.

### User Experience Flow
1. User sees "Advanced Mode" toggle in main interface
2. User toggles switch
3. Modal popup appears with:
   - "Advanced mode is coming soon!"
   - List of potential advanced features
   - "I'm interested - let us know!" button
   - Option to request specific features
4. Button click creates GitHub issue automatically
5. Modal closes, toggle returns to off position

### Advanced Features List (for popup)
- **Tax Implications Calculator**: Factor in tax rates for different scenarios
- **Multiple Debts & Investments**: Handle complex portfolios
- **Dynamic Payment Schedules**: Increasing payments over time to account for wage growth
- **Actual Investment Funds**: Investment returns based on actual investment funds/strategies

### Technical Implementation
- Simple toggle component (existing UI library)
- Modal popup component
- GitHub Issues API integration for anonymous issue creation
- Issue created with:
  - Title: "Advanced Mode Interest - [timestamp]"
  - Labels: ["feedback"]
  - Body: optional details regarding specific features they'd be interested in

### GitHub Integration Details

## Feature 4: Donation/Tip Support

### Objective
Provide users with a simple way to support the project through donations while maintaining the minimal-dependency approach.

### Implementation Strategy
**Phase 1: Placeholder Implementation (Immediate)**
- Simple "♥️ Support this project" button in footer
- Links to placeholder page or modal with "Coming soon" message
- Prepared for easy activation once GitHub Sponsors is approved

**Phase 2: GitHub Sponsors Integration (Post-Verification)**
- Update button to link directly to GitHub Sponsors page
- Add optional donation amounts/tiers messaging
- Track donation referrals via analytics

### Technical Implementation
```jsx
// Placeholder component ready for activation
<a 
  href={GITHUB_SPONSORS_URL || "#"} 
  target="_blank" 
  className="support-link"
  onClick={!GITHUB_SPONSORS_URL ? handlePlaceholderClick : undefined}
>
  ♥️ Support this project
</a>
```

### User Experience
- **Current**: Button shows "Support coming soon" modal
- **Post-Approval**: Direct link to GitHub Sponsors page
- **Placement**: Subtle footer positioning, non-intrusive
- **Messaging**: Grateful but not pushy tone

### Environment Variables
- `GITHUB_SPONSORS_URL`: URL to GitHub Sponsors page (empty until approved)

---

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- **Existing**: All current dependencies remain unchanged
- **New**: No additional npm packages required (using fetch API)

### Environment Variables
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Fine-grained token with read/write access to repositories
- `GITHUB_SPONSORS_URL`: URL to GitHub Sponsors page (empty until verification approved)

### API Integration
- GitHub REST API for issue creation
- Anonymous issue creation (no user auth required)
- Error handling for API failures
- Rate limiting considerations

### UI Components Needed
1. Advanced Mode Toggle
2. Modal Popup (reusable for both features)
3. Feedback Button
4. Simple Form Components

### Performance Considerations
- SEO pages must load quickly for search ranking
- Modal components should be lazy-loaded
- GitHub API calls should not block UI
