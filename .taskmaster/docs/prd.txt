# Invest vs Debt Calculator - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
A financial calculator application that helps users determine whether their additional cash flow should be allocated toward paying off debt or contributing toward investments. The application provides a clear, data-driven comparison with visual charts to support decision-making.

## Core Functionality

### Application Structure
- **Single Page Application**: No landing page required - users go directly to the calculator
- **No Tab Navigation**: All three information sections are visible simultaneously on one page
- **Real-time Calculations**: Results update immediately as users input data

### Primary Question
**"Should the user's additional cash flow be allocated toward paying off debt or contributed toward investment?"**

## Feature Specifications

### 1. Debt Information Section
- **Current Debt Amount**: Dollar input field
- **Current Interest Rate**: Percentage input field (annual rate)
- **Minimum Payment Frequency**: Dropdown (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually)
- **Minimum Payment Amount**: Dollar input field
- **Time Remaining on Debt**: Input field with default value of 30 years

### 2. Investment Information Section
- **Current Investment Amount**: Dollar input field
- **Expected Rate of Return**: Percentage input field (annual expected return)

### 3. Cash Flow Information Section
- **Cash Flow Frequency**: Dropdown options
  - Lump-Sum
  - Weekly
  - Bi-weekly
  - Monthly
  - Quarterly
  - Annually
- **Cash Flow Amount**: Dollar input field

## Chart Requirements

### Primary Visualization
- **Dual-line Chart**: Shows debt balance and investment balance over time
- **Time Horizon**: Extends until debt is paid off or a reasonable investment timeline
- **Key Milestones**:
  1. **Crossover Point**: Highlight when investment balance would surpass debt balance (if applicable)
  2. **Coverage Point**: Highlight when expected investment returns could cover minimum monthly debt payment without reducing investment principal (if applicable)

### Decision Output
- **Clear Recommendation**: Simple statement indicating whether investing or paying off debt is more optimal
- **Disclaimer**: Include "Not financial advice" disclaimer

## User Experience Requirements

### Design Principles
- **Premier User Experience**: Intuitive, smooth, and responsive interactions
- **Amazing UI Design**: Modern, clean, and visually appealing interface

### Usability Features
- **Input Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions and feedback during calculations
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant for screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Clear Section Separation**: Distinct visual boundaries between the three main sections
- **Prominent Chart**: Chart should be the focal point of the page
- **Actionable Results**: Decision recommendation should be highly visible

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Calculations and chart updates should be instantaneous
- **Smooth Animations**: Chart transitions and UI interactions should be fluid
- **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient chart rendering for complex time series data

### Data Handling
- **Input Persistence**: Remember user inputs during session
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Financial calculations must be precise and reliable
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful handling of extreme values or invalid inputs

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Time spent on calculator and completion rates
- **Decision Confidence**: Users should feel confident in the recommendation provided
- **Return Usage**: Users return to recalculate with different scenarios
